      <h1>Prohibition Era</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prohibition_in_the_United_States"
          >Prohibition</a
        >
        in the United States was a nationwide constitutional ban on the
        production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages
        from 1920 to 1933. Prohibitionists first attempted to end the trade in
        alcoholic beverages during the 19th century. Led by pietistic
        Protestants, they aimed to heal what they saw as an ill society beset by
        alcohol-related problems such as alcoholism, family violence and
        saloon-based political corruption. Many communities introduced alcohol
        bans in the late 19th and early 20th century, and enforcement of these
        new prohibition laws became a topic of debate. Prohibition supporters,
        called "drys", presented it as a battle for public morals and health.
        The movement was taken up by social Progressives in the Prohibition,
        Democratic, and Republican parties and gained a national grassroots base
        through the Woman's Christian Temperance Union.

        Consumption of alcoholic beverages has been a contentious topic in
        America since the colonial period. In May 1657, the General Court of
        Massachusetts made the sale of strong liquor "whether known by the name
        of rum, whisky, wine, brandy, etc." to the Indians illegal. In general,
        informal social controls in the home and community helped maintain the
        expectation that the abuse of alcohol was unacceptable. "Drunkenness was
        condemned and punished, but only as an abuse of a God-given gift. Drink
        itself was not looked upon as culpable, any more than food deserved
        blame for the sin of gluttony. Excess was a personal indiscretion."
